# ESS-DIVE Reporting Format for location metadata v 1.0.0

## About the reporting format
The locations reporting format is intended to guide users in providing a minimal set of guidelines for reporting metadata about locations.

This reporting format was developed by synthesizing the requirements for reporting locations from ESS-DIVE's existing reporting formats. We also took into consideration 12 other locations-related standards, conventions, guidelines and reporting formats to determine which elements would contintute a minimal set of appropriate metadata.


## Quickstart Guide
  1. **Read** reporting format [instructions](instructions.md) to understand how to fill out templates.
  2. **Download** blank copy of [reporting format template]()
  4. **Save** your completed locations metadata template as a CSV file and upload to ESS-DIVE as part of your dataset.

## How to contribute
